# LAYOUT

The layout is based on a subset of keys, especifically the keys offered by the Corne keyboard.

# IDEAS FOR UNUSED KEYS

Here are some ideas that I have to put the extra keys to use.

- Swap Ctrl with Super
- Quick access to a standard layer, for gaming
- Use some QMK Macros
- Define a QMK Leader Key
- Swap language (super + space in Linux)
- Close current window/tab (ctrl + shift + w)
- Change desktop (ctrl + alt + up/down in Linux)
